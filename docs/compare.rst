.. _compare:

Result comparison
-----------------

Currently, the following output file types are supported:

**default**
    This is equivalent to the ``diff`` command-line utility
**null**
    No comparison is performed (used when a difference should not indicate a test failure).

I am aware that this list is very limited. In a future version, it will be possible to add custom comparisons via user extensions.
